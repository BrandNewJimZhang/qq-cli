## Build and test

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -e . pytest
.venv/bin/pytest
```

`tests/test_mappers.py` covers the mapping layer with recorded upstream
shapes. Every behavior change lands with a test in the same commit:
the test fails before the change and passes after.

## The cross-repo schema contract

This resolver and
[`netease-cli`](https://github.com/BrandNewJimZhang/netease-cli)
publish the SAME schema field for field, so one caller can fan out to
both and merge the rows. Any change to the envelope, a `data` shape, an
`error_class` or an exit code must land in BOTH repositories and bump
`schema_version` — a half-landed schema change breaks every merged view
downstream.
